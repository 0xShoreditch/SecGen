# Lecture Videos and CyBOK

The Cyber Security Body of Knowledge (CyBOK) is a body of knowledge that aims to encapsulate the various knowledge areas present within cyber security. Scenarios within SecGen now contain XML elements linking them to CyBOK knowledge areas and specific topics within those knowledge areas. Additionally, video lectures for  scenarios are tagged with their CyBOK associations.

This file is an autogenerated index of the lecture videos referenced by scenarios -- with CyBOK metadata.

There are 48 videos with CyBOK metadata.
